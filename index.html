    <!-- Article 1: The Universe is Expanding! -->
    <div class="article">
      <h2>The Universe is Expanding!</h2>

      <p>
        Ever since Edwin Hubble's groundbreaking observations, scientists have
        understood that our universe is continuously expanding. This expansion
        means that galaxies are moving away from each other, and the fabric of
        space itself is stretching over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most intriguing aspects of this discovery is the role of
        dark energy. Dark energy is believed to be the mysterious force driving
        the accelerating expansion of the universe. Despite extensive research,
        its exact nature remains one of the biggest puzzles in modern
        astrophysics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implications of an expanding universe are profound. They affect
        theories about the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the cosmos,
        posing questions that scientists continue to explore.

    <!-- Article 2: Black Holes Can Evaporate -->
    <div class="article">
      <h2>Black Holes Can Evaporate</h2>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x600/?blackhole,space" alt="Black Hole" />
      <p>
        Black holes have long been thought of as eternal cosmic monsters that
        devour everything in their path. However, Stephen Hawking's discovery of
        what is now known as Hawking Radiation challenged this view.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Hawking, quantum effects near a black hole’s event horizon
        allow it to emit radiation. This radiation causes the black hole to lose
        mass gradually over time, eventually leading to its evaporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the process is extremely slow—taking far longer than the age of
        the universe for most black holes—it has major implications for our
        understanding of gravity, quantum mechanics, and the life cycle of
        celestial objects.

    <!-- Article 3: Quantum Particles: In Two Places at Once -->
    <div class="article">
      <h2>Quantum Particles: In Two Places at Once</h2>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x600/?quantum,science" alt="Quantum Mechanics" />
      <p>
        Quantum mechanics often defies our everyday understanding of how the
        world works. One such puzzling phenomenon is superposition, where
        quantum particles like electrons can exist in multiple states or even
        locations at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea was famously illustrated in the double-slit experiment,
        demonstrating that particles can behave like both particles and waves.
        Until an observation is made, the particle exists in a combination of
        all possible states.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principle of superposition is not only fascinating—it’s also
        fundamental to emerging technologies such as quantum computing, where
        it allows for processing speeds far beyond those of traditional
        computers.
